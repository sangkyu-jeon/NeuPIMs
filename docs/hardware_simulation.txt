Hardware Simulation Modules
===========================

This document describes the modules that emulate hardware behaviour in the NeuPIMs simulator.

Core Overview
-------------
- `src/Core.h` and `src/Core.cc` define the basic interface for a processing core.
- Each core handles instructions and interacts with SRAM scratchpads.
- Variables such as `_core_cycle` track the current simulated cycle.
- Functions like `cycle()` step the core through time.

Key Variables
-------------
- `_compute_pipeline` : queue holding instructions that are being executed.
- `_ld_inst_queue` : queue for load instructions awaiting issue.
- `_acc_spad` and `_spad` : scratchpad SRAM models storing activation data.
- `finish_cycle` in each instruction indicates when an operation completes.

Complex Syntax
--------------
- The code uses C++ `std::queue` and `std::vector` containers to manage pipelines.
- Weak pointers (`std::weak_ptr`) link instructions to parent tiles without owning them, avoiding circular references.
- Macros such as `ast()` wrap assertions for readability.

Module Description
------------------
- The `Core` class is subclassed by specific core implementations such as `SystolicWS` for weight-stationary systolic arrays.
- Each cycle, the core checks pipelines, issues memory requests and updates scratchpads.
- See `src/SystolicWS.cc` for an example core that manages vector operations and accumulation.

Verification Procedure
----------------------
1. Build the simulator using the steps in `README.md`.
2. Run with a small configuration file (e.g., `configs/systolic_ws_128x128_dev.json`).
3. Check debug output from `spdlog` to confirm pipeline stages behave as expected.
4. Compare results with known behaviour of similar NPU simulators like [ONNXim](https://github.com/PSAL-POSTECH/ONNXim).

Additional Modules
------------------
- **Sram** (`src/Sram.h`/`src/Sram.cc`): models on-chip scratchpad memories.
  - `_cache_table` : associative map tracking allocated entries per buffer.
  - `reserve()` and `fill()` update validity bits when memory requests load data.
- **Dram** (`src/Dram.h`/`src/Dram.cc`): abstract base for DRAM models.
  - `PIM` subclass integrates NewtonSim for in-memory operations.
  - `get_channel_id()` maps a `MemoryAccess` to a memory channel.
- **Interconnect** (`src/Interconnect.h`/`src/Interconnect.cc`): routes memory
  requests between cores and DRAM.
  - `SimpleInterconnect` provides a latency-based model using per-channel queues.
  - `Booksim2Interconnect` hooks into the BookSim2 network simulator.

See the individual documentation files `sram.txt`, `dram.txt`, and
`interconnect.txt` for more details on these components.
